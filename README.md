# Food-Forecasting-Analysis
Your client is a meal delivery company that operates in multiple cities. They have various
fulfilment centres in these cities for dispatching meal orders to their customers. The client
wants to help these centres with demand forecasting for upcoming weeks so that these centres
will plan the stock of raw materials accordingly.
The replenishment of the majority of raw materials is done on a weekly basis and since the raw
material is perishable, procurement planning is of utmost importance. Secondly, staffing of the
centres is also one area wherein accurate demand forecasts are really helpful. We have the
below information with us in the form of 3 different datasets:
● Historical data of demand for a product-centre combination
● Product (Meal) features such as category, sub-category, current price and discount
● Information for fulfilment centres like centre area, city information, etc.
